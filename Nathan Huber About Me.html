			<h2><u>College</u></h2>            
			<p class="AboutMe">Currently at the University of Cincinnati, I am involved in a few positions in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. As a CEAS Ambassador I show potential students and their families around the 				Engineering College and answer any questions they have about the program or UC. I also sit in on student/faculty panels where the potential students and their families can ask more specific questions directed at their 				intended major.</p>
			<p class="AboutMe">A career goal I have had is to become a teacher after working a few years in the field to gain real world experience. To get a taste of what it would be like to be in a teaching position, this year I became a 				Teaching Assistant in the first year course Engineering Foundations. With this I am able to assist the Professor by incorporating the lecture material into the lab, answer any questions in lab the students may have, and 			grading the lab reports with feedback for the students to improve upon.</p>

			<p class="AboutMe">Aside from the recent leadership positions I have obtained, I have also been fairly involved at UC since my first year. As a first year I was a part of the First Year Leadership Program as well as being the 			President of the 8th Floor in Dabney Hall. I have also participated in the CEAS Tribunal since being a first year as well, attending the meetings and keeping up to date on what is going on within the college.</p>

			<p class="AboutMe">Giving back to the community has always been important to me. Over the last couple years I have participated in a few things within the Cincinnati area to give back such as handing out medals at the Heart 				Mini, assisting with coaching a T-ball league hosted by the Cincinnati Reds, tutoring students at Hughes High School, and spending the night running games at the Cancer Free Kids Night for the Fight event. </p>

			<h2><u>High School</u></h2>  
			  
			<p class="AboutMe">While still in high school, I was able to get a head start in Electronics through the Career Compact Center, Tri-Star. Within Tri-Star's recently renamed Robotics, Electronics, Computers, Technology Course I 				was able to gain skills that prepared me for the course load I received in college as well as giving me a background to begin working in the field before many of my other peers.</p><br>

			<p class="AboutMe">SkillsUSA is a Nationwide club for students in Career Technical Programs, to learn their specific skills while using a Parliamentary system of government within the program. Both years in Tri-Star I was my 				Chapter's President for RECTech. With this position I organized fundraisers and orchestrated the monthly Chapter meetings reviewing goals, budget, and activities. During my senior year in the program, I competed at State 				level and qualified for Nationals. In Kansas City I represented the State of Ohio in Electronics Technology where I was able to place 12th in the Nation.</p><br>

			<p class="AboutMe">In 2013 I was awarded the highest rank in Boy Scouts of America, the Eagle Scout. Throughout my sophomore and junior year of high school I spent all of my time rejuvenating one of my home town's historical 				cemeteries. This involved landscaping, restoring and relocating headstones, and creating a peaceful and welcoming atmosphere for the community. With all the work put into this project and all of the merit badges earned over 			the years, I was seen as going above and beyond the requirements and was awarded the Bronze Palm on top the Eagle Scout Rank. </p><br>
